						<h1>Hi, I'm John!</h1>
						<p class="person__text">
							This is me, I’m a person who is positive about every aspect of
							life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to
							experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I
							like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
						</p>

						<p class="person__text">
							I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the
							moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I
							like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at
							the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought
							experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like
							flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in
							winter.
						</p>

						<p class="person__text">
							I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone,
							I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like
							metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I
							like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and
							comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like
							the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.

							<h2>Meet the love of my life</h2>
							<p class="dog__description">
								Lucas, my little Lucas. Oh, have we had a long road with this
								one. He’s incredibly smart but so terribly anxious. New things
								threaten Lucas. He’s ever-vigilant. While he’s terrified of the
								broom, the vacuum, and so on.
							</p>
							<p class="dog__description">
								He howls when he doesn’t get his way. But he’s also playful. Put
								a puppy in the room, and Lucas will play until he drops. He
								jumps, leaps, spins, and flings whatever plaything he can find.
								He hates hugs but implores us to rub his ears and scratch his
								butt.
